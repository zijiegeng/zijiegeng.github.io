# About me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in [SChool of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://saids.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in the [School of the Gifted Young (SGY)](http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/) at USTC in 2022.
I am working towards my Ph.D. degree in the [MIRA Lab](https://miralab.ai/) at USTC, under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Wang](https://miralab.ai/people/jie-wang/).
My current research interests include Leanring to Optimize and AI4EDA.
If you share similar interests or have any inquiries, please feel free to contact me by email.
