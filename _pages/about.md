I am currently a second-year Master student in [Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science (EEIS)](https://en.sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at [the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in [the School of the Gifted Young (SGY)](http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/) at USTC in 2022.
I am working towards my Ph.D. degree in the [MIRA Lab](https://miralab.ai/) at USTC, under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Wang](https://miralab.ai/people/jie-wang/).
My current research interests include Graph Generation, AI4Science, and Reinforcement Learning.
If you share similar interests or have any inquiries, please feel free to contact me by email.
