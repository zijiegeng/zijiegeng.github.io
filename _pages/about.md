# About me

I am currently a second-year graduate student in [Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science (EEIS)](https://en.sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in the [School of the Gifted Young (SGY)](http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/) at USTC in 2022.
I am working towards my Ph.D. degree in the [MIRA Lab](https://miralab.ai/) at USTC, under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Wang](https://miralab.ai/people/jie-wang/).
My current research interests include Graph Generation, AI4Science, and Reinforcement Learning.
If you share similar interests or have any inquiries, please feel free to contact me by email.

## Education

## Research

### Research Interests

I have broad research interests, and I have not fully decided where I want to go in the long term. I started my research from reinforcement learning (RL). During my internship in MSRA, I studied molecular generation for drug discovery. After that, I applied the graph generation techniques for learning to optimize (L2O).

  I with several good friends set up this company after graduating from high school. Our goal: "Bring People Together, Make The World Better." We developed many interesting websites and APPs, such as [TalesStreat](https://www.talesstreet.com/index.html).

## Interests

- Texas Hold’em Poker. I find it so fun, though I don't play well. I am trying to learn GTO theory. I also like some other board games like Guandan and Legends of the Three Kingdoms.
- Chinese chess. I used to practice Chinese chess for several years. Now I play occasionally, but not as well as I used to.
- Mathematics. When I was young, I dreamed of becoming a mathematician. Soon I found out that I was not good at math. However, I still want to say I love mathematics.
- Debating. I was the team leader of the debate team of School of Gifted Young. But I gave up when I started research.
- Making new friends. So welcome to contact me!
